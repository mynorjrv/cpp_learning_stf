A repo to learn C++.
I am following Programming Abstractions in C++
the CS106B-beta reader from Stanford.

examples/ are files that I make following the book.
The notation 1-4.something.cpp means is a numbered example from the book.
The notation 1.3.something.cpp means is something related to chapter 1 but is not a numbered example, 3 would be a count on this type of examples starting from 0.
Names uses underscore to separate words.

my\ solutions/ are solutions to the handouts of the CS106 course from stanford.

Solutions\ to\ the\ book/ are some problems from the book that I solved.
It uses the notation 1.2.Something.cpp where 1 corresponds to the chapter number and 2 corresponds to the number of the problem.
For some reason xd I used uppercase to indicate words xd


The material (including videos and the handouts) for this course is available 
on https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B with professor Julie Zelenski
