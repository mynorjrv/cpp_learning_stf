A repo to learn C++.
I am following Programming Abstractions in C++
the CS106B-beta reader from Stanford.

examples/ are files that I make following the book.
The notation 1-4.something.cpp means is a numbered example from the book.
The notation 1.3-something.cpp means is something related to chapter 1 but is not a numbered example, 3 is a count on this type of examples.

my\ solutions/ are solutions to the handouts of the CS106 course from stanford.

The material (including videos and the handouts) for this course is available 
on https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B with professor Julie Zelenski
