1. When you write a C program, do you prepare a source file or an object file?

    When you write a C program you create a source file that contains the text of the program. The compiler translates it into an object file which combined with other object files (using a linker) produce an executable file.

2. What characters are used to mark comments in a C++ program?

    // for inline (used for parts that are not yet complete)
    /* */ for blocks

3. In an #include line, the name of the library header file can be enclosed in either angle brackets or double quotation marks. What is the difference between the two forms of punctuation?

    <> is for standard libraries (a system library)
    "" is a non standar header file written by you of that come frome otrher library

4. How would you define a constant called CENTIMETERS_PER_INCH with the value 2.54?

    const double CENTIMETERS_PER_INCH = 2.54;

5. What is the name of the function that must be defined in every C++ program? What statement typically appears at the end of that function?

    int main () {
        return 0;
    }
    
    The value reports the status of the program. 0 indicates succes.

6. What is the purpose of endl when you are writing to the cout output stream?

    It is the end-of-line swquence, which ensures that next output operation will begin on a new line.
    Youtube recomends using "/n" if I am still printing things.

7. Define each of the following terms for variables: name, type, value, and scope.

    Emmm name is... the name of the variable? Not sure how to define it.
    type indicates the data type(?) for that specific variable.
    value is the specific value(?) a variable takes.
    Scope is the region in which the variable is accessible.

8. Indicate which of the following are legal variable names in C++:
(pos24)
    Legal names:
        x
        formula1
        average_rainfall
        tiny
        aVeryLongVariableName
        b4hand
        _stk_depth
        
    Non legal names:
        %correct
        short
        marginal-cost
        total output
        12MonthTotal

9. What are the two attributes that define a data type?

    A domain, which is the set of values that belong to the data type.
    A set of operations, which defines the behavior of that type.

10. What is the difference between the types short, int, and long?

    The three are integers and C++ does not specify the range for these types. The internal size cannot decrease as you move from short to int to long. The maximum value of int must be at least 12^15 - 1. The maximum value of long must be at least 2^31 - 1

11. What does ASCII stand for?

    American Standatd Code fro Information Interchange

12. List all possible values of type bool.

    true and false

13. What statements would you include in a program to read a value from the user and store it in the variable x, which is declared as a double?
    
    #include <iostream>

    double x;
    std::cin >> x;

14. Suppose that a function contains the following declarations:

    int i;
    double d;
    char c;
    string s;
    
    Write a statement that displays the values of each of these variables on the screen, along with the name of the variable so that you can tell the values apart.
    
    std::cout 
        << "i = " << i << "/n"
        << "d = " << d << "/n"
        << "c = " << c << "/n"
        << "s = " << s << endln;

15. Indicate the values and types of the following expressions:
    2 + 3: int
    19 / 5: int (because both operands are int)
    19.0 / 5: float
    3 * 6.0: float
    19 % 5: int
    2 % 7: int

16. What is the difference between the unary minus and the subtraction operator?

    The unary minus is for making a value negative (negation).
    The subtraction operator is for subtracting(?), and is a binary operation.

17. What does the term truncation mean?

    It is called truncation when the decimal fraction is discarted.

18. What is a type cast and how do you indicate one in C++?

    Is an explicit conversion from one type to another.
    It is usually implemented using the name of the desired type followed by the value to convert in parentheses. 
    
    For example int(9.0) or double(3).
    
    Data loss could happen depending on the conversion.
    
    (Youtube recomends avoiding this type of casts)

19. Calculate the result of each of the following expressions:

    6 + 5 / 4 - 3 :
    2 + 2 * (2 * 2 - 2) % 2 / 2 :
    10 + 9 * ((8 + 7) % 6) + 5 * 4 % 3 * 2 + 1 :
    1 + 2 + (3 + 4) * ((5 * 6 % 7 * 8) - 9) - 10 :

20. How do you specify a shorthand assignment operation?

    variable op= expression; (where op is a binary operator)
    
    for example i += 1;

21. What is the difference between the expressions ++x and x++?

    Prefix form increments the value of x first, then uses the new value as the value of the ++ operation as a whole.

    Suffix form calculates the value of x first, and the increments it. The value returned to the surrounding expression is the original value before the increment operation is performed.

22. What is meant by short-circuit evaluation?

    It is used for Boolean operands, it means that the evaluation of an expression stops as soon as the result is known.
    
    For example, in exp1 && exp2, if exp1 is false then it is already known that the whole espession is false.

23. Write out the general syntactic form for each of the following control statements: if, switch, while, for.

    if (condition) statement
    if (condition) statement else statement
    
    (e is a control expression)
    switch (e) {
        case c1:
            statements
            break;
        case c2:
            statements
            break;
        ...
        case cn:
            statements
            break;
        default:
            statements
            break;
    }
    
    while (contidion) statement
    
    for (int var = start; var <= finish; var++) statement

24. Describe in English the operation of the switch statement, including the role of the break statement at the end of each case clause.

    It is used for a more complex decission structure than just a true of false. First, it evaluates the control expression and compares against the values c1, c2 and so forth. If one of the values matches, the statements are executed. Then, when the program reaches the break statement, the program continues with the statements after the entire switch.
    
    An empty case is used for making case clauses representing two posibilities. For example
    
    case 1:
    case 2:
        statements
        break;
        
    This works because when the break statement is missing the program starts executing statements from the next clause after it finishes the selected one.

25. What is a sentinel?

    Is a special value that signals the end of an input.

26. What for loop control line would you use in each of the following situations?

    Counting from 1 to 100 
        for (int i = 1; var <= 100; i++)
    Counting by sevens starting at 0 until the number has more than two digits
        for (int i = 0; var < 100; i+=7)
    Counting backward by twos from 100 to 0
        for (int i = 100; var >= 0; i--)
